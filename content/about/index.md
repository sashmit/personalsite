Hi, welcome to my blog. I occaisionally post content here. 


This site runs in top of Hugo, an open source static site (serverless) written in Go. 

I use blogdown in Rstudio to compose most posts.

I use netifly to host the site on my domain.

The tech stack it runs in top of is probably most associated with the JAMStack (https://jamstack.org/).
