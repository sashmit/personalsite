Hi, welcome to my blog. I occasionally post content here. 

This site runs in top of Hugo, an open source static site (serverless) written in Go. 

I use [blogdown][1] in [Rstudio][2] to compose most posts.

I use [netifly][3] to host the site on my domain.

The tech stack it runs in top of is probably most associated with the [JAMStack][4].
